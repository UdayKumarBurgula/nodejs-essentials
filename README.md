These are the code examples for Node.js Essentials

You can get the book [here](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/nodejs-essentials)

The code examples are grouped together first by chapter, then by code execution, each time the code is run there is a new code file. This is so you can run through each example and have running working code, while seeing the progression. 

The exception is with the CoffeeScript chapter (chapter 10) where there is no executes code, so the code is split up into concepts (simple, existential operator, objects & arrays, classes)

For readers that have downloaded these example files from the PacktPub website you can receive updates from [here](https://github.com/fabiancook/nodejs-essentials)

## Running code

Node.js version 4.2 or above is required for all these examples (lower versions will most likely work, however this is untested)

For each chapter that requires external modules there will be a `package.json` file, in the directory of that chapter run `npm install` in your terminal or command line to install these modules
